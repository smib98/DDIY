# DDIY - Drag and Drop Python script builder
A JavaScript based drag and drop workflow builder designed to assist with building Python Automation Scripts. This is to be used as part of a greater project im working on to allow everyday users to bring automation to their jobs in a similar way to how Power Automate works.

This is only part of a bigger project i'm working on and uses Flowy.js at its core. Please feel free to re-use this however you wish.

## Important Information
I know the JavaScript files formatting in this project is **GARBAGE** and can be simplified significantly. This project is not finished yet and will be optimised/refactored soon.

## Want To Help?
If you have managed to fix any bugs, implimented new features or just have a cool suggestion, feel free to fork this repo or get in touch to conribute to this project.

## How To Use
1. Download this repo
2. Open the index.html file in your favourite web browser.
3. Done! your good to go, all running locally in your browser.

# To-Do
• Make dragging blocks to the canvas add code to the code editor pane instead of just the block name.
• ~~Make any interaction with the canvas cause the current code to be saved (currently doesnt have save functionality)~~
• Add auto save feature
• Replace template actions etc, with real items
• Make properties pane have relevant useful functionality.
• Refine and refactor code

# Known Issues
• Broken Zoom / Panning functionality
• When the script re-imports a saved project, dragging a block already on the canvas breaks everything.
